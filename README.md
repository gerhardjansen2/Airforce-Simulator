# Airforce-Simulator

Simulate an aircraft flying through enemy territory, by calculating the shortest route. 
The route will dynamically recalculate when the obstacles are moved to find a safe path for the aircraft to bomb the enemy base. 
The aircraft first scouts the enemy base and returns to base. 
The aircraft then calculates the shortest route to bomb the high priority targets in the enemy base. 
The aircraft then returns to base and a report is given.
